## Lab 08 - Calculations
___

Create a program that uses these formulas below

## Objective

Write these programs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1) Write a user driven program(using switch-case) to calculate the areas of the following three shapes.
```
-Area of a rectangle is length*breadth. Enter length and breadth of a rectangle and print its area.
-Area of a square is its side*side (or side^2). Enter the side of a square through user and print its area.
-Area of a circle is π*r^2 (π*r*r)<==>(3.14*r*r). Where π=3.14 and r is the radius of the circle.
Enter the radius of a circle through user and print its area.
```
### 2)WAP to input the makers of following five subjects from the user and print the Percentage and result based on that percentage.
```
Georgian, English, Maths, Science, Computers. Marks should be out of 100.
Percentage=(Marks of all 5 subjects/500)*100.
	Percentage 		Result
	<40			FAIL
	>=40 and <50		THIRD
	>=50 and <60		SECOND
	>=60 and <75		FIRST
	>75			FIRST WITH DISTINCTION
```
### 3)WAP to enter a distance in Kilometers(km) and print equivalent distance in meters(m), feet(ft), inches(in) and centimeters(cm).
	1 km = 1000 m =>  m = km*1000
	1 m = 3.3 ft  =>  ft= m * 3.3
	1 ft = 12 in  =>  in= ft * 12
	1 m = 100 cm  =>  cm= m * 100
### 4) WAP to enter a number and print its reverse.

### 5) WAP to enter a number and check if its a palindrome or not.

### 6) WAP to enter two numbers and swap them using a third variable and print them
### 7) WAP to enter a number and swap and print them without using a third variable.
### 8)WAP to enter a number and check if its an even number or an odd number.
### 9)WAP to enter any year from the user and check if it's a leap year or not.
### 10) WAP to enter three numbers from the keyboard and print the smallest and largest of those numbers.

### 11) WAP to enter marks in 5 subjects out of 100. If marks in any subject is less than 33 then it's a faliure. Your program should output the no. of subjects the person is failing in else it should print PASS.
