#What is Software Testing?

It is a method to check whether the actual software product
matches expected requirements and to ensure that software
product is Defect/Bug free.


## Why do we need software testing?

To gain customer confidence

To check software adaptability

To identify errors

To avoid extra costs

To avoid risks

To optimise business


## Software defect/bug can be fatal!

E.g. Boeing 747 Max airplane crash

Software defects may cause

Loss of billions.

E.g. Google authentication

crashed in 2020

## What is a software application?

Application is software that performs specific tasks for an end-user.
Application software programs are created to facilitate a variety of functions,
including but not limited to:

- managing information

- manipulating data

- coordinating resources

- calculating figures

- Facebook, slack, zoom and etc...

## How to build a software?

1) Planning
2) Analysis
3) Design
4) Build
5) Testing
6) Deploy
7) Maintain

#SDLC

- **Software development life cycle** is a process for planning, creating,
testing, and deploying an information system.

The goal of a SDLC is to allow successful production of a high-quality
solution that would meet or exceed the requirements of a customer
at all its phases, within the provided budget and timelines.


## PLANNING

Identification of the system for development

Creation of project plan

Find scope solution

Estimate cost and efforts

Identify risk and benefits

## Requirements Gathering

Architects, developers, and product managers document the business
processes that need software automation.

Focus on functional requirements

Perform solution analysis

Identify End Users needs

**Requirement**: is a service, function or feature that a user needs. Requirements can be
functions, constraints, business rules or other elements that must be present to meet
the need of the intended users.

**Functionality of an application**: Functionality is the sum or any aspect of what a
product, such as a software application or computing device, can do for a user.


### Source of Requirements:

Customers

Business Partners

Domain Experts

Industry Analysts

End-Users


### Requirement Gathering:

Product owner (PO) documents(writes) the requirements:

Business Requirements (BR)

System Requirement Specification (SRS)

Market Requirements (MR)

Functional Requirements (FR)

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)


## System Requirement Specification (SRS)

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a document that describes what the
software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It also describes the
functionality the product needs to fulfill all stakeholders (business, users) needs.

## Requirement Gathering

### Requirements should be SMART:

Specific

Measurable

Attainable

Realistic

Testable


# S.M.A.R.T.

**Specific Requirement**

- All users should be able to see all the foods

**Measurable Requirement**

- The application should function quickly

**Attainable Requirement**

- The users can decide the foods order by their name

**Realistic Requirement**

- The users get discounts whenever the user want

**Testable Requirement**

- I want application remarkable

## DESIGN

Developers and software architects start designing the software after
they have identified requirements.

Elaborate core specification, features, functions, and flows to meet
the requirements.


## DEVELOPMENT

Developers will obey certain predefined coding guidelines during this
process.

Actual development begins here following the design. Code reviews,
unit testing are done.


## TESTING

QA team tests the software for errors/bugs and determines if the
solution meets the business goals.

Testers refer to the document to make sure the software conforms to
the customer’s standard.


## Software Deployment

In this phase, the goal is to deploy the software to the manufacturing
environment so that consumers can start using the product.

After successful testing, software gets deployed in production
environment for user acceptance and approval.


## Benefits of SDLC:

Using the SDLC it is easy to measure the growth and costs of the
developed system

SDLC enhances the control and monitoring of the big or complex
projects.

SDLC involves well detailed and comprehensive steps.

The design reviews help to ensure the reliability and quality of the
developed solution.

SDLC provides extensive documentation of the system.


## The List of SDLC models

The list of SDLC models which have gained popularity and accepted industry-wide throughout the years:

- Spiral Model
- V Model
- Waterfall Methodology
- **Agile Model**

The list of SDLC models which have gained popularity and accepted industry-wide throughout the years:

- Spiral Model - is an example of an iterative development.  Risk handling.
- V Model - Verification and validation model.
- Waterfall Methodology - it's very simple but idealistic. 
- **Agile Model** - is a time bound, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of a project, instead of trying to deliver all at once.

## AGILE/WATERFALL

### Agile 
- smooth segregation of a project into useful parts
for better results.
- Cumulative outcomes.

### Waterfall 
- Comprehensive and holistic view towards the implementation of a project.   
- Big outcome at the end.


# Waterfall Methodology

Requirements --> Design --> Implementation --> Testing --> Deployment 

# Agile methodology

Able to move quickly and easily.  Agile is a software development methodology.


# Agile is a Software Development Methodology

- People work together as one team

- More human communication, and face-to-face interaction

- Continuous feedback from users

- Visibility of progress and transparency of process

- Shorter development cycles, and more frequent deployment


# Agile Methodology 12 Principles/Rules

1) Satisfy the customer
2) Welcome change
3) Deliver frequently
4) Work together
5) Trust and support
6) Face to face converstaion
7) Working software
8) Sustainable development
9) Continous attention
10) Maintain simplicity
11) Self organizing teams
12) Reflect and adjust

## Welcome change
In the world around us, change is the only constant.  Agile principles and values support responding to these changes rather than moving us forward in spite of them. 

## Face to Face conversations
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation.

## Working software
Working software is the primary measure of progress.  Ship software often: a useful product now is better than a perfect one later.

## Maintain Simplicity
Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.


## Agile Manifesto: Agile vs Non-Agile

### Agile                             
- Individuals and
Interactions

- Working Software

- Customer Collaboration

- Responding to Change


### Non-Agile
- Process and tools
- Comprehensive
- Contract Negotiations
- Following a Plan


### Agile Software Development Methodologies

- Scrum
- Crystal
- Kanban
- XP
- FDD
- RUP
- DSDM
- and a few more ....


### Agile has several frameworks

- XP (Extreme Program)
- **Kanban**
- **Scrum**
- Crystal
- RUP (Rational Unified Process)

## Agile - Scrum

- Scrum is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the highest business value in the shortest time.

- Scrum uses iterative process.

- The business sets the priorities.  Team self organize to determine the best way to deliver the highest priority features.


## Advantage of Using Scrum Framework
- Scrum framework is fast moving and money efficient
- Scrum is adaptive in nature because it has short spring.  
- In Scrum customer, satisfaction is very important.


## Disadvantage of Using Scrum Framework

- Daily meetings sometimes frustrate team members

- Adopting the Scrum framework in large teams is challenging

- The chances of project failure are high if individuals aren't very committed or cooperative

## Scrum Roles

1) Product Owner
2) Scrum Master
3) Development Team


## PRODUCT OWNER

- The Product Owner is a central role within the Scrum Framework

- He represents the end customer or stakeholders.

- Defines the product in the customer-focused terminology (typically user stories)

- Adds them to the product backlog

- Prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies

- Decides on release date and content

- Accept or reject work results

- Responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)

- Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to
all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next;


## SCRUM MASTER

- A Scrum Master helps the scrum team perform at their highest level.

- Helps the PO maintain the product backlog.

- Coaching the team, within the Scrum principles.

- Organizes the work of the team and provides it with everything necessary

- Scrum Master is there to serve team, he or she has no
authority over the team

- Ensure that the team is fully functional and productive

- Represents management to the project


## Development Team

- A Development team is a group of individuals like developers, testers, etc. who work
together to deliver the requested and committed products

- The Development Team builds the product that the Product Owner indicates: the
application or website

- The Development Team is a cross functional, small and self-organizing team which
owns the collective responsibility of developing, testing and releasing the Product
increment.


## Business Analyst

- The business analyst is the person responsible for aligning what the customer
wants with what the team is producing. The BA works as a bridge between the
business and the technical team, looking for gaps and analyzing impact.

- The BA is expected to:

- Define the project requirements

- Keep the focus on the project

- Understand and define the stakeholders’ needs

## The Stakeholder

Stakeholder is anyone with a vested interest in the product who is not part of the Scrum Team.

- Business organization
- Regulators
- Clients
- Customs
- Subject matter experts
- Team captain
- Business Owner
- Product Champion
- Agile Actuary


## Lifecycle of Scrum

### Sprint:
A Sprint is a time-box of one month or less. A new Sprint starts immediately after
the completion of the previous Sprint.

### Release:
When the product is completed then it goes to the Release stage.

### Sprint Review:
If the product still have some non-achievable features then it will be checked in this
stage and then the product is passed to the Sprint Retrospective stage.

### Sprint Retrospective:
In this stage quality or status of the product is checked.


# Scrum Artifacts
Product Backlog

Sprint Backlog

Increment

Sprint Burn-Down Chart


## Product Backlog
- The Product Backlog is an ordered list of features that are needed as part of the end
product and it is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the
product.

- The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes
that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases.

- Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the
Product Owner’s discretion.


#Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint,
plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Team about what functionality will be
made available in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that
functionality as a working product Increment.


##Increment

- The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed
during a Sprint combined with the increments of all previous Sprints.

- Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint.

- Any one product should have a definition of Increment that is a standard
for any work done on it.


# Sprint Burn-Down Chart

Sprint Burn-Down Chart is a practice for trending the work expended by the scrum team.

At any point in time in a sprint, the total work remaining in the sprint backlog can be summed.


# Sprint Calculation

**Assume that**:

There are total 18 User Stories in the product backlog

PO estimate the release date for 3 months

If the sprint is 2 weeks, how many sprints a team go through to finish
the work?


# Scrum Ceremonies

**Grooming Meeting**: Before the meeting PO Prioritize the product backlog and we
estimate points for each user story

**Sprint Planning**: This is where the team meets and decides what they need to
complete in the coming sprint

**Daily Scrum**: This is a standup meeting, or a very short – 15-minute
mini-meeting – for the team to make sure they’re all on the same page.

**Sprint Review**: This is another type of meeting, but one in which the team demos
what they shipped in the sprint.

**Sprint Retrospective**: This is when the team reviews their work, identifying what
they did well and what didn’t go as planned, so they can make the next sprint
better.


# Grooming Meetings

- Hosted by PO

- Before the meeting PO prioritize the product backlog

- Dev Team estimate points for each user story

- Scrum team, Dev team and PO are involved

- Every beginning of each sprint we have grooming meetings once.


# Sprint Planning

- Hosted by PO

- Take user stories that can be finished in one sprint From Product backlog to sprint backlog

- Plan for upcoming 1 sprint only

- Who are involved => Scrum team

- At the beginning of each sprint, once, after grooming meeting


# Daily Stand -Up Meetings

**Hosted by : Scrum Master**

**Answer 3 questions:**

- 1.What did I do Yesterday ?

- 2.What am I going to do today?

- 3.Is there any impediment ? Blocker ? Problem ?

- Every day, 15 minutes ,

- Dev team + Scrum Master are involved


# Sprint Review

- Hosted by : Scrum Master or PO

- Developers and testers demonstrate their work that they done during the sprint to PO, and client.

- When and how many times you have this meeting?

- Once At the end of the sprint

- Who are involved? Scrum team + Customer


# Retro Meetings

**Hosted by : Scrum Master**

**Answer or discuss 3 questions**:

1) What went well?

2) What was not going well?

3) How can we improve?

**Who are involved?**

1) Dev team + Scrum master

**When and how many times you have this meeting?**

1) At the end of the sprint , after Demo meeting


# Kanban vs. Scrum
### Kanban
- continuous flow, continuous delivery, no required roles, Lead time, cycle time, WIP


- Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in
progress, and maximizing efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams
focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project(or user
story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban
board and continuously improving their flow of work.


### Scrum
- Regular fixed length sprints (ie. 2 weeks), at the end of each sprint, product owners, scrum masters, development team, velocity


- Scrum teams commit to ship working software through set
intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to
quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams
adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular
ceremonies to keep things moving forward.
